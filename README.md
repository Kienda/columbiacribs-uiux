# ColumbiaCribs — UI/UX Case Study

ColumbiaCribs is a **student-focused housing review platform** designed to help  
Columbia University students discover, evaluate, and review campus buildings  
through **trusted peer feedback**.

This project was completed as a **team-based academic UI/UX project**, with a
strong emphasis on usability, clarity, and trust in student decision-making.

## Problem

Columbia students often struggle to find **reliable and centralized information**
about campus housing.

Existing resources are:

- Fragmented across platforms
- Informal or word-of-mouth based
- Outdated or inconsistent

This makes it difficult for students to confidently choose housing options.

---

## Solution

ColumbiaCribs provides a structured and student-verified experience that allows users to:

- Browse campus housing buildings
- Read consistent, structured peer reviews
- Submit their own housing experiences
- Make informed housing decisions based on real student feedback
